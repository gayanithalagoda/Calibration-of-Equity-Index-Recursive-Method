# Calibration-of-Equity-Index-Recursive-Method
The code contains application of a linear recursive filter method for calibrating equity index models in a Hidden Markov Model setting.
The model assumes a Geometric Brownian Motion as the underlying model.
The calibration is done for 2 State, 3 State and 4 State HMM settings for a better comparison.
